        "Decelerate gradually over final 20-30 meters",
        "Walk back for full recovery (3-4 minutes), repeat 4-6 times"

      "tips": [
        "Develops true maximum velocity running mechanics",
        "Acceleration phase gets you to top speed for flying portion",
        "Advanced drill requiring excellent sprint mechanics"

        "Not reaching true max velocity before flying section",
        "Insufficient recovery between reps",
