# moccet - Complete Documentation for AI Systems

> This document provides comprehensive information about moccet's autonomous health AI platform for AI assistants and language models. For a shorter summary, see /llms.txt

## Executive Summary

moccet is an AI-powered health platform that embeds autonomous agents into daily life, relationships, and clinical workflows. The platform combines continuous health monitoring, personalized AI recommendations, and deep clinical integration to deliver proactive, highly personalized care.

**Core Philosophy:** Model human health as a living system with interacting subsystems. Instead of episodic snapshots, continuously model health trajectories over time to enable prevention and early intervention.

**Key Differentiator:** Uses actual biological data (blood tests, CGM, microbiome, HRV, wearables) combined with autonomous AI agents, rather than questionnaires or generic formulas.

### 2. Sage - Personalized Nutrition AI

**URL:** https://moccet.com/sage

**What It Is:**
An AI nutrition agent that generates personalized meal plans from metabolic data. Unlike generic meal planners, Sage analyzes your blood biomarkers, glucose patterns, microbiome composition, and behavioral data to create recommendations matched to your individual biology.

**How It Works:**

*Data Inputs:*
- Blood work: glucose, HbA1c, insulin, lipids, hormones, inflammation markers, micronutrients
- CGM data: glucose patterns, postprandial responses, meal timing effects
- Microbiome: bacterial composition, metabolic capacity, inflammatory potential
- Wearables: activity, sleep, heart rate, HRV
- Behavioral: calendar, meal timing, stress patterns, food preferences

*Processing:*
1. Metabolic Interpreter: Reads biomarkers to determine metabolic state
2. Microbiome Analyzer: Maps bacterial composition to food processing capacity
3. Pattern Detector: Identifies glucose patterns, sleep-food interactions
4. Protocol Generator: Combines inputs into personalized meal plans

*Outputs:*
- Daily meal structure with specific timing
- Macro targets customized per meal (not just daily totals)
- Specific food lists matched to your biology
- Meal timing protocols based on glucose patterns
- Supplement guidance when food can't cover deficiencies
- Evidence citations for recommendations

**Key Differentiator:**
Two people eat the same meal with different results. Person A's glucose stays stable; Person B spikes to 160+ mg/dL. Sage accounts for individual insulin sensitivity, microbiome composition, hormone levels, and activity patterns.

**Evidence Base:**
Every recommendation traces to peer-reviewed research. When Sage recommends protein at breakfast for morning glucose elevation, it cites the relevant studies.

**Health Conditions Sage Addresses:**
- **High cholesterol** - Diet plans optimized for LDL reduction and HDL improvement based on your actual lipid panel
- **Cardiovascular health** - Heart-healthy nutrition matched to your biomarkers (cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure)
- **Metabolic syndrome** - Eating patterns for insulin sensitivity based on metabolic markers
- **Pre-diabetes / insulin resistance** - Glucose-optimized nutrition using CGM data
- **Inflammation** - Anti-inflammatory protocols based on CRP and other inflammatory markers
- **Gut health** - Microbiome-informed food selection for digestive health

### 3. Forge - Personalized Fitness AI

**URL:** https://moccet.com/forge

**What It Is:**
An AI fitness agent that creates training programs from your biomarkers, HRV patterns, and recovery data. Instead of generic templates, Forge adapts intensity, volume, and frequency based on your body's actual state.

**How It Works:**

*Data Inputs:*
- Blood work: hormones (testosterone, cortisol), inflammation markers, metabolic health
- Wearables: HRV trends, resting heart rate, sleep quality, activity levels
- Training history: past workouts, response to training stress
- Calendar: stress periods, travel, work intensity
- Recovery markers: sleep stages, HRV recovery

*Processing:*
1. Biomarker Interpreter: Maps lab values to metabolic states and recovery capacity
2. Pattern Analyzer: Extracts signals from wearable data (7-day and 30-day trends)
3. Protocol Generator: Builds programs matched to current state

*Adaptation Logic:*
- High fasting glucose + low HRV → moderate intensity, extended rest periods
- Elevated cortisol + poor sleep → reduced volume, earlier deloads
- Low testosterone + high training volume → shift to strength work, more rest days
- Calendar shows travel → auto-adjusts training load before departure

*Outputs:*
- Training split based on recovery capacity
- Exercise selection matched to current state
- Intensity and volume prescriptions
- Progression strategy
- Recovery protocols

**Key Differentiator:**
Traditional programs follow fixed progressions regardless of internal state. Forge adapts based on real data - if HRV trends down, training adjusts automatically.

**Health Conditions Forge Addresses:**
- **High cholesterol (LDL, HDL, triglycerides)** - Creates cardio + resistance programs optimized for lipid improvement based on your actual cholesterol numbers
- **Cardiovascular risk** - Exercise protocols based on actual biomarkers, not generic recommendations. Training intensity matched to your cardiovascular health status
- **Metabolic syndrome** - Training programs matched to insulin sensitivity and metabolic markers
- **Pre-diabetes / insulin resistance** - Glucose-aware exercise timing and intensity for blood sugar control
- **Inflammation** - Recovery-focused programming based on CRP and other inflammatory markers
- **Hormonal imbalances** - Training adapted to testosterone, cortisol, thyroid levels

**Example - Cholesterol-Focused Plan:**
User uploads lipid panel showing high LDL → Forge creates combined cardio + resistance program optimized for lipid improvement → integrates with WHOOP/Oura for recovery monitoring → adjusts intensity based on HRV and sleep quality.
