# Moccet - Autonomous Health AI Platform

> Moccet is an AI-powered health platform that embeds autonomous agents into daily life, relationships, and clinical workflows. It combines continuous health monitoring, personalized AI recommendations, and clinical integration to deliver proactive, highly personalized care. The platform uses actual biological data (blood tests, CGM, wearables, microbiome) rather than questionnaires or generic formulas.

## Platform Overview

Moccet models human health as a living system with interacting subsystems. Instead of episodic snapshots, it continuously models health trajectories over time, enabling prevention and early intervention. AI agents monitor patterns across sources, surface the few things that matter each day, and orchestrate actions like bookings, logistics, and coordination with clinicians.
